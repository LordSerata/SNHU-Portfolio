Client Overview and Software Needs 

The Gaming Room, our client, tasked us with enhancing their game, "Draw It or Lose It," to work across different tech like phones, tablets, and computers. They needed a setup that could adjust to more users, keep private info safe, and make sure the game runs smooth and fun for everyone. 

  

Documentation Strengths 

Creating the plan, I did a good job breaking down the tech talk into simpler terms. This way, everyone could get what the game needed tech-wise. I suggested using big cloud services to make sure "Draw It or Lose It" can grow and keep up with lots of players at once. 

  

Why Design Documents Help 

Writing out all the tech details first made the actual building of the game easier. It's like having a recipe when you're cooking – you know what to do step by step. This prep work helps avoid messing up when you're in the middle of making the game. 

  

What I'd Rework 

If I had a do-over, I'd focus way more on the assignment guidelines. I've realized that I might have missed the mark a few times in class because I didn't follow the instructions closely. Next time, I'd double-check to make sure I understand everything that's expected before diving in. 

  

Understanding Players' Needs 

In designing a game, it would be crucial to decode what players might need, like intuitive interfaces and quick load times. It's all about balancing the fun stuff with the technical bits, ensuring the game is not only entertaining but also runs like a dream, with minimal bugs and smooth performance. 

My Design Approach 

For designing, I started by listing what the game should do and then chose the tech to make that happen. Next time, I'd use the same steps – figure out what's needed, then pick the tools to build it. It's like picking the right ingredients for a recipe so the dish turns out good.
